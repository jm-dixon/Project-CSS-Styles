# Project-CSS-Styles
A group of CSS files used to support work projects

This repository is made up of a group of CSS files that I use to support my own projects.

Mostly, these files contains vars for various different aspects of styling, exceptions to this rule are the files 'flexbox.css' and 'grid.css' which contain shorthand css classes for flexbox and grid respectively.

Each file has a short description of the contents found in the file at the top and some example usage scenarios.
