# Project-CSS-Styles
A group of CSS files used to support work projects

This project is mainly made up of CSS files which contains vars for various different aspects of styling. The only exceptions to this rule and the files 'flexbox.css' and 'grid.css' which contain shorthand class names for flexbox and grid. This is used for faster development and shorter CSS stylesheets.

The commits in this repository are simply for my own personal reference, they are not written for external viewing. Each fle contains a description of the contents at the top and examples of how the file contents can be used. These are written as documentation and are meant as the primary reference point over the commit messages. 

This repository is public and can be used by anyone who wishes, although I will not be taking recommendations on improvements as I wrote this primarily for my own personal use to support my own GitHub projects. Anyone may copy either the entire repository or just singular files though if they wish.
